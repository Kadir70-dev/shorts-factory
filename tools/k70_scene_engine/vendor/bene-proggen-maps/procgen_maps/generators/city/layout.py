"""City block + street layout generation.

Two modes selected by `CityPreset.layout_mode`:

- 'grid': a regular lattice of rectangular blocks with light jitter
  (Kleinstadt, Dorf presets - regular, orderly towns).
- 'raster': seed points scattered and partitioned via a numpy-vectorized
  nearest-seed raster scan (Voronoi-like; no scipy dependency - see
  ARCHITECTURE.md). Each block's footprint is approximated as an
  axis-aligned rectangle around its assigned cells' bounding extent rather
  than an exact cell polygon; this keeps buildings.py's per-block extrusion
  simple while still producing organically varied block sizes.

Pure Python/numpy only - no bpy here. generators/city/streets.py and
buildings.py turn this data into meshes.
