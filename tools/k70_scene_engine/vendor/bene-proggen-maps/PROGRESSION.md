## v0.9.0 — Dungeon interiors, park/parking vibrancy, driver-based animation (current)

Scoped from the user's list after v0.8.1 shipped: "improve the dungeon, make
animation and better tree / terrain and fountain, park, parking spaces, less
cars to make it more vibrant and more."

**Dungeon rooms were open-topped, unmaterialed shells with corridors
dead-ending against solid walls.** `generators/dungeon.py` built only a
floor + 4 flat walls per room - no ceiling, no doorway where a corridor
actually connects, no materials, no lighting. Rewritten so every corridor
segment's start-or-end point is exactly some room's own `.center` (true by
construction of `connect()`), which means the wall a corridor exits
through - and where along it - can be read directly off that segment's own
direction, no geometric intersection test needed. `_find_doorways` +
`_wall_segments_with_gaps` use this to cut real gaps in the walls; rooms
now get floor + ceiling + 4 walls-with-doorways across 3 material slots
(new `materials/dungeon_mat.py`), the largest room is tinted as the "boss"
room and the smallest as the "start" room, and a torch (bracket mesh +
warm point light) lights every doorway.

**Tree canopies were only ever a plain cone or a plain sphere.** Added a
third "cluster" shape - 3 overlapping icospheres at different sizes/offsets
- cycled across the 12 tree variants alongside the existing two, so a
street doesn't read as identical balls-on-sticks.

**Parks had trees and benches but no centerpiece.** Large park blocks
(>= 400 sqm) now get a fountain (stone base, a tinted water ring, a
central pillar) placed before the tree/bench scatter, so those naturally
avoid overlapping it via the same collision grid every other prop uses.

**Supermarkets had no parking, and every local street was lined bumper to
bumper with cars.** Supermarket footprint shrink dropped from 0.92 to 0.55
- shrinking a block-centered footprint frees an equal margin on all 4
sides, and the entrance-facing margin now becomes a real parking lot (new
`generators/city/parking.py`): a terrain-following asphalt pad, painted
stall-divider lines, and a grid of parked cars in one or two rows with a
drive aisle. Roadside car spacing widened from 6m to 10m so cars read as
parked, not welded together - parking lots pick up the slack for a livelier
feel overall.

**Static cities felt static.** Added lightweight, keyframe-free animation
via Blender's driver expressions (`sin(frame*freq+phase)*amplitude` -
`frame` is available directly in a scripted driver's expression namespace,
no variable needed, confirmed by direct test): every tree Empty gets a
subtle back-and-forth sway on its own X/Y rotation, frequency/phase/
amplitude seeded from its own location so a row of trees doesn't sway in
lockstep. Lit building windows (`materials/city_mat.py`) get a slow
sine-driven emission pulse layered on top of the existing night-mode
emission strength, phased per-building using each building's own
`procgen_maps_tint` attribute (already computed for facade-color
variation) - one shared material, one driver, no per-window objects
needed, verified by checking the driven node's evaluated value and the
actual rendered pixel brightness both change across frames.

## v0.8.1 — Street/terrain follow-up, a real interior-view tool, higher render quality

Direct follow-up to v0.8.0's bug list, scoped narrowly per request.

**Streets still clipped into terrain on long runs.** v0.8.0 fixed buildings
sitting flush on the ground; streets had the same root cause in a
different shape - `_build_road_strip` built exactly one flat quad per
edge regardless of length, sampling terrain height only at its 4 corners.
A 100m+ arterial can have real undulation between those two endpoints
that never gets sampled, so the strip either clips into a hill or leaves
a gap over a dip along its length even though both ends match the ground
exactly. Fixed by chopping any edge longer than 12m into chunks, each
sampling its own corners - the same reason the terrain mesh itself is a
fine grid and not one giant quad.

**"How do I render a building's interior?"** - added a real one-click
answer: a **Render Interior View** button (targets the selected building,
or the first one found) that frames a camera at the entrance and renders
through the glass. Getting this to actually show something took two real
fixes: an occlusion-safe camera placement (a straight-line raycast backs
the camera off in 1m steps until the entrance isn't blocked by a
neighboring building across a narrow street - block gaps can be under the
naive 8m default), and, more fundamentally, discovering that **EEVEE
Next's screen-space transmission cannot show a room whose only
visibility is through the very window being looked through** - screen-space
methods only reflect/refract data already visible somewhere on screen,
and an interior with no other line of sight has nothing else to draw
from, so EEVEE rendered a flat, empty-looking wall no matter how the
camera was aimed. Confirmed by rendering the identical camera and scene
in Cycles (true ray tracing) - the interior light and furniture read
clearly. The new button renders with Cycles specifically for this
reason; slower (roughly a minute or two vs. seconds), but it's the only
engine that actually delivers what the feature promises.

**4K quality, a second pass.** Beyond the resolution/sample bump already
in v0.8.0, enabled ambient occlusion (`use_gtao`, quality 1.0) and pushed
shadow ray/step counts and diffuse GI bounces up - all one-off costs
worth paying for a hero render, not the live viewport.

## v0.8.0 — Bugfix round: terrain grounding, signage clutter/traffic lights, raytraced glass, 4K defaults

A direct user bug report ("terrain still bugging and overlapping, many signs
not on the street, cars not aligned, too many street signs and no traffic
lights, no glass for windows/no interior visible") drove this round. Root
causes, investigated with a live diagnostic pipeline (headless renders of a
worst-case sloped building, a top-down car/street check, and a raytracing
on/off comparison) before touching any code:

- **Terrain "overlapping"**: the visible terrain mesh was far too coarse
  (256x256 over a 1000m world, ~3.9m/cell) relative to the noise detail
  every building/street/prop/sign samples *exactly* via
  `sample_world_height` - the coarse mesh simply couldn't agree with the
  precise value everything else used, so buildings could clip into or
  float above the ground on any real slope (measured up to 8m of height
  variance under one building's own footprint). Fixed two ways:
  terrain resolution doubled to 512, noise gentled (broader scale, one
  fewer octave, roughly half the old amplitude) so the mesh and the
  sampled field agree far better everywhere; and a new
  `generators/terrain.py:flatten_terrain_for_footprints`, called from
  `generate_city` right after building placement, locally reshapes the
  ground mesh under every building footprint to match that building's
  own already-chosen base height, with a smooth blend at the edges - a
  building's foundation is now guaranteed flush with the visible ground,
  not just statistically likely to be close.
- **Too many stop signs, no traffic lights**: `signage.py`'s stop-sign
  rule now exempts the one pair of incident edges most nearly opposite
  each other at any intersection (`_find_through_pair`) - the priority
  "through" route, mirroring how a real minor junction works - roughly
  halving stop-sign counts at ordinary 4-way intersections. Any
  intersection with 2+ arterial approaches gets a new decorative
  red/yellow/green traffic light instead of nothing (previously an
  accepted gap). Speed-limit repeater spacing was also widened.
- **Signs not on the street**: the stop-sign/street-name setback distance
  was never clamped against the incident edge's own length - on a short
  block-corner edge it could push the sign's position past the far
  endpoint entirely. Now capped at 40% of the edge's own length.
- **No glass, no visible interiors**: window transmission
  (`materials/city_mat.py`'s glass material) only actually renders as
  see-through with EEVEE Next's raytracing enabled - which was previously
  only ever turned on inside the one-off Showcase Render button, never
  for the main generate flow or the live viewport. Both `Generate
  Terrain` and `Generate City` now enable it by default.
- **4K quality defaults**: Showcase Render resolution default raised to
  3840x2160 at 256 samples (from 1280x800/128).
- Investigated but not a bug: parked-car rotation/offset math checked out
  correct (length axis matches the street direction, offset matches the
  curb-clearance formula exactly) - the "not aligned" impression traces
  back to the same terrain-mismatch root cause above, now much reduced.

## v0.7.0 — Street signage/traffic logic + a Lighting configuration panel

Two features this round. **Street signage** (`generators/city/signage.py`):
deterministic, rule-based sign placement driven by the street graph's own
intersection degree and street_class hierarchy, not a random density
roll. A local approach at any real (3+-way) intersection gets a stop
sign; an all-arterial intersection gets none (no traffic-light feature
exists here - an accepted scope boundary); every street gets speed-limit
repeater signs (50 km/h arterial, 30 km/h local) at a class-dependent
interval; and every arterial approach at a real intersection gets a
street-name sign, one name per edge (a small deterministic word bank) so
both ends agree. All three are bespoke mesh+FONT objects built directly
in the new module (mirroring `special_buildings.py`'s sign-building
idiom), collision-checked against buildings/props/other signs via the
same `SpatialHashGrid` pattern `props.py` uses.

Discovered along the way: raster-mode presets (Metropole, Industrial)
currently produce a street graph where *every* node has degree 1 - no
real intersections at all - because `_raster_street_segments` computes
each block's street-exit point per-neighbor from that neighbor's own
center-line direction, so a block touching 3+ neighbors never gets
coincident exit points to snap into one junction. Stop signs and
street-name signs are therefore grid-mode-only (Kleinstadt, Dorf) for
now; speed-limit signs are unaffected (purely per-edge). Documented in
signage.py's module docstring as a known, pre-existing limitation rather
than silently worked around - fixing the raster topology itself is a
separate, larger change.

**Lighting panel** (`ui/panels.py`): promotes what used to be hardcoded
constants scattered across `operators.py`/`world_mat.py`/`city_mat.py`
(sun elevation/rotation, day/night sun energy, night-mode window glow
strength, street lamp energy) into seven live-tunable Scene properties,
each wired through a `night_mode`-style `update=` callback (no separate
"Apply" button - these are cheap in-place property writes, not a
regenerate). An adversarial review pass (multi-agent) caught two real
gaps before shipping: the Showcase Render operator was still using its
own independent hardcoded sun constants instead of the new panel values
(fixed - `ensure_showcase_sun` now accepts the panel's elevation/rotation,
converted between the Nishita sky's elevation-from-horizon convention and
the Sun light object's zenith-angle convention), and the new
`set_sun_energy`/`set_sun_position` functions could have silently
overwritten an unrelated World's settings if dragged before "Generate
Terrain" was ever clicked (fixed - both now check `world.name` first).

## v0.6.0 — Special buildings: supermarket, police station, hospital, fire station, school

Five unique, zone-targeted building types beyond the 12 generic facades,
placed by explicit selection logic (`generators/city/special_buildings.py`)
rather than the random per-block facade pick `buildings.plan_buildings`
uses: each city gets one police station, hospital, fire station and school
(largest available block in an allowed zone), plus a supermarket every ~45
blocks (so bigger cities get more than one). Reuses `buildings.BuildingPlan`/
`FacadeType` directly - each special type is just a `FacadeType` with its
own fixed floor count/height and an extended material_index (12-16 in
`city_mat.py`'s facade color ramp) instead of a randomly rolled one, so the
exact same shell/window/roof/interior mesh construction applies unchanged.
`generate_city` now reserves each special building's block before handing
the rest to `plan_buildings`, so a block never gets both.

Every special building gets an illuminated sign - a real Blender Text
object mounted on the entrance facade, not a texture, so it's readable at
any render distance - plus, for hospitals specifically, a rooftop helipad
(a flat disc + a raised "H" marking). Furniture catalog
(`assets/library.py`) extended with per-type interior sets (hospital beds,
police desks, supermarket shelving/counters, etc.) for the ground-floor
interiors every building already gets.

New pytest coverage in `test_generators.py`: reserved-block/plan bookkeeping
is consistent, special buildings never land on park blocks or reuse a
regular building's block, `min_blocks_required` correctly gates small
cities out of types they're too small for, supermarket count scales with
city size, planning is deterministic for a given seed, and every spec has a
unique material index.

## v0.5.0 — New feature: "Render Showcase Image" tool

Every render/screenshot in this document up to now came from a one-off
Python script written by hand each time (bounding-box math, camera
placement, sun setup, EEVEE settings) - none of that lived in the addon
itself. This turns it into a real, reusable feature: a new `rendering/`
subsystem (`framing.py`, pure-Python bounding-box-to-camera-placement math,
fully pytest-covered; `showcase.py`, the bpy build step that creates the
camera/sun and configures+triggers the render) plus a **Render Showcase
Image** button in a new N-panel section, with an angle dropdown (Overview /
Close-up / Low Angle) and a resolution field. One click auto-frames a
camera on whatever's been generated, sets up sun position for day/night,
turns on raytracing for correct glass transmission, and renders straight to
the export directory - no more hand-tuning a script per screenshot. This is
meant to keep improving over future rounds (more angle presets, depth of
field, compositor-based color grading, etc.).

## v0.4.0 — Procedural sky + facade/terrain material detail for higher-quality rendering

First rendering-quality pass (materials only - no new generator logic).
Every `generate_terrain` call now sets up a real Nishita procedural sky
world (`materials/world_mat.py`) instead of a flat background color, so
renders get physically-based sky gradient, sun, and ambient lighting for
free; night mode dips the same sky's sun below the horizon rather than
swapping to a separate flat-color night world. The city facade material
mixes in an Object-space noise "grain" (stable per building, not flickering
with world position) on top of the flat per-facade color, plus a matching
Bump for micro-surface detail - and the terrain material got the same
treatment (speckle noise breaking up the flat height-band colors, finer
noise driving its own bump). All purely procedural shading tricks - no
image textures, no extra geometry/subdivision - consistent with the
addon's no-baked-assets approach everywhere else.

## v0.3.1 — Fixed remaining block/building overlaps in raster-mode presets

A live-session screenshot on Metropole showed buildings visibly overlapping
each other - a bug the v0.3.0 prop/building overlap fix didn't cover, since
that fix only kept *props* out of buildings, not buildings out of each
other. Root cause: raster-mode blocks (Metropole, Industrial) are built
from the axis-aligned bounding box of an irregular Voronoi-like cell, and
for non-convex or oddly-shaped cells that bbox can still extend into a
neighboring seed's actual territory even after the existing fill-factor
shrink - so two blocks (and the buildings placed on them) could overlap.
Grid-mode presets (Dorf, Kleinstadt) were never affected. Measured 156
overlapping block pairs / 41 overlapping buildings on Metropole and 37 / 11
on Industrial before the fix.

Rather than trying to reconstruct the true (possibly concave) cell polygon
just for a tighter initial estimate, `generate_layout` now resolves the
*invariant* directly: any pair of blocks whose rectangles still overlap
gets shrunk along whichever axis has the smaller overlap until their
projections on that axis no longer intersect, which by the AABB
separating-axis test guarantees no overlap regardless of the other axis.
A few passes settle chains of mutually-touching blocks. Blocks shrunk down
to a sliver by this process are dropped. Verified 0 block and 0 building
overlaps across all 4 presets, with a regression test added.

**Metropole, seed 1 — rendered (raytracing enabled, no more transmission ghosting either):**

## v0.3.0 — Detail pass, ground-floor interiors, overlap fix

Building facades got real per-instance variety (jittered window frequency/
pitch/floor height so same-facade buildings stop looking identical), a
proper wide entrance recess on the ground floor, and a chance at a rooftop
utility unit on flat-roofed buildings. Every building now gets a simple
furnished ground-floor interior (floor, ceiling, warm light, 2-3
facade-appropriate furniture pieces from a new catalog) visible through
actually-transmissive window glass. Also fixed two real bugs surfaced by
this pass: props could still spawn overlapping buildings in the denser
raster-layout presets (Metropole, Industrial) because `SpatialHashGrid`'s
collision search radius didn't account for large registered items (like a
building's bounding circle) — only the query's own small radius. Verified
0 overlaps across all 4 presets after the fix, with a regression test
locking it in.

## v0.2.0 — Core bug fixes: grounded props, real materials, working windows/roofs

Fixed the issues visible in the first end-to-end test: props (trees, lamps,
benches) were floating above or buried under sloped terrain because
`props.py` hardcoded z=0 instead of sampling the heightmap; nothing had a
real material assigned (props showed as flat gray, and Blender's Solid
viewport shading ignores shader node graphs entirely, reading a separate
`diffuse_color` field instead); and — the deepest bug of this round —
window/roof detail had never actually rendered because of a `bmesh` quirk:
`extrude_face_region`'s own return value only reports the single moved top
face and silently drops the 4 newly-created side faces every time, so the
window-carving code had been running against nothing since it was written.
Fixed with a proper before/after face diff, added a real gable roof (ridge +
two slopes, not a single-point pyramid poke), and nested `ProcgenMaps_City`
correctly under the addon's root collection instead of as a stray sibling.

## v0.1.0 — Initial functional build

First end-to-end pass: 4 presets, terrain, the full layout → zones → streets
→ buildings → props pipeline, a BSP dungeon generator, and glTF/FBX/USDZ/
SVG/JSON export, all verified via a headless Blender smoke test. Visually
rough: props floating/buried relative to terrain, flat gray materials, and
buildings that were plain extruded boxes with no visible window or roof
detail — the issues v0.2.0 above fixes. No image captured for this
milestone (issues were reported via a live screenshot in conversation,
not saved to a file at the time).
